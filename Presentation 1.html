# Introduction and Design challenge

**Stealth focused asset pack that can be implemented into other games easily.**

*How do I design and make a reusable pack of assets*:

- Is the documentation sufficient?
- Can developers implement their own systems into the assets?
- Are the assets fun for the player?
- Is the difficulty adjustable enough?


This is explained further in the *Concept* document in the portfolio.

<hr>

Final product:

- Asset pack with documentation
- (Basic) game using the asset pack.
- Playtests result with users.
- Test if developers understand the asset pack.
