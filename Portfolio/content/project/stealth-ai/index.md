Personal project to create a stealth focussed asset pack.

Reading guide would be perfect here.

## Research

The main question asked for research is:

*How do I design and make a reusable pack of assets*:

Operators that could support this question are:

- Is the documentation sufficient?
- Can developers implement their own systems into the assets?
- Are the assets fun for the player?
- Is the difficulty adjustable enough
