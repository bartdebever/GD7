Around the time of writing this, the game called Untitled Goose Game (UGG) was released
for Nintendo Switch and the Epic Games' store not too long ago. The title is a
great success on both platforms and has taken the world by storm, managing to be
the best selling game on the Nintendo Switch's online store and getting into
pop/nerd culture.

## Core gameplay loop

In UGG, the player is presented a task list that they have to complete.
These tasks are completed one by one but don't necessarily have to be completed in
order.
