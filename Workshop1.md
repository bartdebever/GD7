## Exercise 1

Define the magic circle of 3 games.

### Tetris

Tetris does not have a story, it has rules:

- The user is able to move the piece both left right and down.
- The user can place pieces and these will stay on the ground.
- These pieces can be cleared for points by making a solid line.
- Pieces have different shapes and are given randomly.
- The user dies when the pieces go over the top of the screen.

### Terraria

The user explores the world that they are placed in, discovering the
interesting places within the world and unfolding a story about the moonlord and it's bosses.

### Hue

Hue is a game where you learn about what happened to the world and the lack
of the colors. You are told the story by your mother and can change the
primary color of the world to solve the puzzles that unlock more colors and
therefore more of the story.

## Exercise 2

Search 3 games and analyse their storytelling.

### Ratchet & Clank (PS2)

The story in Ratchet & Clank is about two adventrous people exploring the
galaxy while being on a quest to find Captain Quark and later on, safe the world.
The story is told using cutscenes and only the exploration is reflected
within gameplay.
The story strictly is there to enhance the gameplay and give the player a goal to get to the end.

### Hue

Hue is mainly about the story and gives these story bits as a reward after a
section of puzzles. The puzzles themselves fit in the setting of the story and
compliment the story by becoming complexer as the story unfolds.

### Screeps

Screeps is an online game where people play against each other in a single world.
It allows interaction between the players in specific ways and in this way allows
the players to create their own story within the defined CIRCLE of the game.
Both on an individual level and on a global level.
The gameplay creates the story.

## Exercise 3

The theme of my game is stealth, this is a theme that I've seen been done wrong a lot.
I want to discover how these games are made and how to make a good stealth game.
The theme will add to the goal of the user-experience design, because of the
theme, they have to learn the system and understand how to dodge the guards.
