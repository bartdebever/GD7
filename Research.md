# How can guard AI vision be implemented to be both fun, fair and intuitive

## What ways of displaying an Guard AI vision is available

There will be a list of ways to display guard AI using examples from other games.
Along with just the technique, other information that will be gathered is:

- Frequency of use in the industry
- Implementations within Unity
- Graphical possibilities with the option (can we change this option to fit multiple themes of game.)

## How does the player experience these vision types

A prototype will be made for each of the vision types found.
The prototype will feature the same exact situation each time the only thing
that is different is the looks of the environment and vision type that the guard has.

The player will then have a short survey on how they experienced the situation,
rating it on a scale of 1 to 10 on the following criteria:

- How **enjoyable** was the experience
- How **realistic** did the guard feel
- How well did you **understand** the guard

The player is then left with an opportunity to leave feedback, if the player fails
to do so, the host will ask questions and note these down.

## Decision matrix

When all the data is gathered, these can be put into a matrix and give the
objective outcome of this research.

Note that the player experience outweighs the implementation aspects of the vision
type as this is ultimately the question at hand. The implementation aspects are
only there as a deciding factor when the scores are equal on player aspect and to
give insights into the development options.

## Peer review

To make sure the view is objective, the decision matrix is reviewed by multiple
peers in an open discussion. The outcome of the research and minor ranking differences
within the matrix might occur.
